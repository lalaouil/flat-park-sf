This app is to help people in wheelchairs or those who have trouble walking. It will help them find street parking, so they can use their handicap placards to park free. Then they can see the flatest route from their car to their target locations.

This is my first project for General Assembly's Web Developement Immersive program. The requirement is to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am required to have 2 models with an association, use partials to DRY up my views, my models should also validate data and handle incorrect inputs. I need to use an external API, and deploy my code to Heroku. My site should have an authentication component and authorization where appropiate.
