This app is the first stage to an app to help people in wheelchairs or those who have trouble walking. It will help them find street parking in San Francisco, so they can use their handicap placards to park free. The app will then show the user the flatest route from their car to their target location.

The app as it currently stands, finds your location and then displays parking options in your area.

This is my first project for General Assembly's Web Developement Immersive program.
